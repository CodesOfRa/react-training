# Client side routing

In order to start building relevant web applications with React, we must have a way of showing different components based on the url visited by the user, otherwise known as **routing**.

There are multiple libraries that are handling routing functionalities in React and there's no official library built by the core team, as there is the case of Vue.js. However, [react-router](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/) is pretty much the standard approach today. Other notable libraries are: [reach-router](https://github.com/reach/router) - accessible first routing library and [router5](https://router5.js.org/)(https://router5.js.org/).
